<h1>Global PVB Encapsulation Films for Photovoltaic Modules Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>PVB encapsulation films market for photovoltaic modules</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 380 million in 2024 to USD 670 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 9.8%</strong>, according to latest industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects rising solar energy adoption and advancements in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) technologies. Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) films have emerged as the encapsulation material of choice due to their exceptional <strong>UV resistance, mechanical durability, and optical clarity</strong> â critical properties for maximizing solar panel efficiency and lifespan.</p><p><strong>1. Solar Energy Infrastructure Expansion:</strong><br>
Global solar PV capacity additions reached <strong>268 GW in 2023</strong>, with projections indicating 350 GW annual installations by 2030. Governments worldwide are implementing aggressive renewable energy targets, with China alone accounting for 55% of new solar deployments last year. PVB films play a crucial role in these installations by protecting solar cells while <strong>maintaining 92-95% light transmittance</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. BIPV Market Acceleration:</strong><br>
The building-integrated photovoltaics sector is growing at <strong>18.4% CAGR</strong>, driven by sustainable construction mandates. PVB encapsulation enables dual-purpose solar glass that serves as both building material and energy generator. Major architectural projects increasingly specify PVB-encapsulated modules for facades, skylights, and curtain walls.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
