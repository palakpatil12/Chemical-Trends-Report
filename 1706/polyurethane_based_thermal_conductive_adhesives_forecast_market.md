            <b>Table of Content:</b><p>Polyurethane Based Thermal Conductive Adhesives is a material that consists of an Polyurethane resin mixed with a Thermally conductive material, Thermally conductive adhesives are often used to dissipate heat from power electronics. Used to bond heat sinks, for example, their heat conductivity reduces thermal strain to prevent performance loss or failure of electronic components. Thermally conductive adhesives are also used as encapsulation compound for temperature sensors for enclosures or reactors. Adhesives with thermal conductivity are synthetic resins augmented with metallic or inorganic filler materials. The best thermal conduction coefficients can be achieved with metallic fillers such as silver or graphite. These, however, also make the adhesive electrically conductive, which is undesirable in many applications. To achieve thermal conductivity and electrical insulation at the same time, adhesives augmented with ceramic or mineral-based fillers must be used.<br />
