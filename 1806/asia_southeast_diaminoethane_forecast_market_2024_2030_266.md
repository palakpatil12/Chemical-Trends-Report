<h1>Southeast Asia 1,2-Diaminoethane Market, Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The <strong>Southeast Asia 1,2-Diaminoethane market</strong>, also known as ethylenediamine (EDA), is poised for steady expansion between 2024 and 2030, driven by its critical role as a chemical intermediate across industrial sectors. While Thailand and Malaysia currently dominate regional consumption, emerging applications in agrochemicals and water treatment are catalyzing demand across Indonesia and Vietnam.</p><p><strong>1. Industrial Chemical Processing Demand:</strong><br>
With Southeast Asia's petrochemical sector expanding at <strong>5.2% annually</strong>, 1,2-diaminoethane remains indispensable for producing chelating agents, epoxy curing agents, and textile auxiliaries. Major resin manufacturers are increasing procurement volumes by <strong>18-22% year-over-year</strong> to meet coatings and adhesive production needs.</p><p><strong>2. Agrochemical Sector Expansion:</strong><br>
Regional governments' push for food security has increased pesticide formulations requiring EDA derivatives. Indonesia's fungicide market alone consumes <strong>3,200 metric tons annually</strong>, with Vietnamese agricultural enterprises reporting <strong>40% year-over-year growth</strong> in herbicide production.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
