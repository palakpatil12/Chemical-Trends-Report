<h1>Global External Antistatic Additive Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>external antistatic additive market</strong> is projected to grow steadily from <strong>USD 427 million in 2024 to USD 638 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a <strong>CAGR of 6.9%</strong>, according to new market research. This growth is driven by escalating demands across electronics, automotive, and medical device industries where static control is critical for operational safety and product reliability.</p><p>External antistatic additivesâsurface-applied agents that dissipate static electricityâhave become indispensable in manufacturing environments. Their ability to prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage makes them vital for <strong>semiconductor fabrication, precision medical equipment, and automotive electronics</strong> where even minor static buildup can compromise functionality.</p><p><strong>1. Electronics Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
The semiconductor sector, growing at <strong>8.2% annually</strong>, accounts for 39% of global demand. With chip manufacturers requiring ISO 14644 Class 1 cleanrooms, antistatic additives prevent particulate adhesion caused by staticâcritical as transistor sizes shrink below 3nm.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
