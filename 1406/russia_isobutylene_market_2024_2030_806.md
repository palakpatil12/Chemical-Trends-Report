<h1>Russia Isobutylene Market Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The <strong>Russia isobutylene market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>US$286.9 million in 2024 to US$368.4 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 4.2%</strong> during the forecast period. This hydrocarbonâa crucial petrochemical building blockâis witnessing rising demand as Russia modernizes its refining and polymer industries while adapting to evolving fuel additive regulations.</p><p><strong>1. Fuel Additive Demand in Refining Sector:</strong><br>
With Russia producing over <strong>5.4 million barrels/day of gasoline</strong>, MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) remains critical for boosting octane ratings. Despite environmental concerns in Western markets, domestic refiners continue optimizing isobutylene-based formulations to meet Euro-5 standards, particularly in high-performance automotive fuels.</p><p><strong>2. Polymer Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
Butyl rubberâconsuming <strong>45% of Russia's isobutylene output</strong>âis experiencing <strong>6% annual demand growth</strong> from tire manufacturers and pharmaceutical packaging sectors. Major players like Nizhnekamskneftekhim are expanding capacities to meet export demand, particularly for medical-grade butyl rubber stoppers.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
