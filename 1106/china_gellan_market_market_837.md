<h1>China Gellan Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The <strong>China Gellan market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 78.6 million in 2024 to USD 112.4 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.1% during 2024â2030</strong>, according to the latest market analysis. This growth trajectory underscores China's increasing dominance in functional food additives and pharmaceutical excipients, where gellan gum serves as a critical gelling agent with superior stability and texture modification properties.</p><p><strong>1. Expansion of Functional Food Sector:<br></strong>The Chinese food industry's shift toward functional and clean-label products has accelerated gellan gum adoption, particularly in dairy alternatives and confectionery. The market for dairy substitutes alone grew by <strong>17% year-over-year</strong> in 2023, with gellan preferred for its heat stability and ability to mimic dairy textures.<br></p><p><strong>2. Pharmaceutical Industry Modernization:<br></strong>China's USD 185 billion pharmaceutical sector is increasingly adopting gellan for controlled-release drug formulations, witnessing <strong>8% annual growth</strong> in excipient applications. The biopolymer's ability to withstand sterilization makes it ideal for emerging mRNA vaccine production lines.<br></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
